Writing Testable Apps with Yeoman
=================================

This is the source code for the sample application from the [Writing Testable Apps With Yeoman] [1] presentation at the  July 10, 2013 Denver AngularJS Meetup. The purpose of the app is to demonstarte the use of [Yeoman] [2] to create a testable, well structured [AngularJS] [3] application, provides examples of integrating testing with [Grunt] [4] and [grunt-karma] [5], and provide general purpose configuration of the [Karma] [6] test runner.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before the application can be run locally, the following steps are required:

1. [Install Yeoman] [7]
2. [Install Karma] [8] - **Not required but helpful when using Karma outside of Grunt**

It's also a good idea to take a look at both of the [Yeoman] [2], [Karma] [6] web pages to get familiar with the core concepts.
